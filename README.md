# memoryGame
A retro grid-based game in JavaScript, HTML and CSS 

This was made with the walkthrough by Ania Kub√≥w [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lhNdUVh3qCc).

[SweetAlert](https://sweetalert.js.org/guides/#getting-started). I used Sweet alert to send the pop up message instead of the usual 'alert()' from javaScript.   

Rules of Memory Game:

    You will start by flipping over one card
    If the next card you flip matches, a pop up alert notifies you and you get +1 to your score
    These cards then disspear
    If the next card you flip does not match, a pop up alert notifies you of this and the cards flip back
    The game continues until you match all the cards on the board
